## ðŸ”ª Instructions

1. **Preheat the oven**  
   - Set the oven to **220Â°C (425Â°F)**.  
   - Pour the **oil or fat** into a roasting tray and place it in the oven to heat.

2. **Prepare the potatoes**  
   - Peel and cut potatoes into even-sized chunks.  
   - Rinse under cold water to remove excess starch.  
   - Drain and **parboil in salted water** for 8â€“10 minutes, until the edges start to soften.  
   - Drain thoroughly and shake the potatoes in the colander to roughen the edges â€” this helps create extra crispiness.

3. **Season and toss**  
   - Carefully remove the hot tray from the oven.  
   - Add the potatoes, **toss to coat in the hot fat**, and season with salt and pepper.  
   - Add **crushed garlic** and **herbs** if using.

4. **Roast the potatoes**  
   - Roast in the oven for **35â€“40 minutes**, turning occasionally to ensure even browning.  
   - Roast until golden brown, crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside.

5. **Serve**  
   - Remove from the oven, season again if needed, and serve immediately.  
   - Perfect alongside roast meats, vegetables, or as part of a classic British dinner.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips
- Use a **starchy potato** variety for the fluffiest interior.  
- Donâ€™t overcrowd the tray â€” space allows maximum crispiness.  
- Shaking the potatoes after parboiling creates rough edges, which is key for crunch.  
- For extra flavor, drizzle with a little **olive oil** and sprinkle with **fresh herbs** before serving.
